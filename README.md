# Country_Clustering_comparison
This repository analyzes country clustering based on socio-economic indicators like GDP, life expectancy, and fertility. Several clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) are tested, with hierarchical clustering at  𝑘 = 3 k=3 producing the best results. The project also includes PCA for visualizing clusters.
